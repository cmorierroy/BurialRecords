# Burial Records

This is a project to learn how to communicate with APIs in Swift. <br>
I'm using the a City of Winnipeg dataset called burial records, which give the cemetary, plot, date of death and name of about 119 000 people in Winnipeg. <br>
https://data.winnipeg.ca/Cemeteries/Burial-Records/iibp-28fx <br>
<br>
Since Find a Grave is already an established website that crowdsources grave information, some of which isn't included in this dataset (date of birth, headstone picture), I'd like to avoid replicating that functionality, and so a functional end goal for this project remains unclear. I may eventually try to use scrape their data instead. <br>
<br>

Current ideas:<br>
• Show data for first (exact) match of a full name. <br>
• Show data (list) for all (exact) matches of last names.<br>
• Show amount of burials per cemetery for all time as a bar plot.<br>
• Show amount of burials for a given cemetery per year as a line plot.<br>
• Attempt to pinpoint specific grave locations within a cemetary and show them on a map. <br>
